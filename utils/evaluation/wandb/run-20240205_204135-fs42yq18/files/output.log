The system may include one single-axis (inverter) module, one dual-axis (inverter), and one PIM module, supporting up to five axes of motion. The PIM module connects to a DSD module, which in turn connects to a Kinetix VPL motor and a DSM module. The DC-bus power supply is typically mounted on one end, while the inverters are positioned on the other end, although the reverse mounting order is also possible. Digital inputs are wired to sensors and the control circuitry at the IOD connectors, and a contactor-enable relay protects the DC-bus power supply during shutdown fault conditions. Additionally, a 2198 Shunt Module may be used as an optional component.'], ['The provided context does not contain information about the purpose of the magnetic contactor (M1) control string in the ArmorKinetix System Servo Drive System, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.'], ['The provided context does not contain information about the significance of the 2198-DBR200-F AC Line Filter in the Extended DC-bus Configuration Example.
